title: The only pedal that I've bonded with
---
Same as any electric guitar player, I suffer from Gear Acquisition Syndrome, or GAS for short. Compared to some of my peers I've managed to curate a relatively small amount of guitar gear: I have 3 amps, 6 guitars, and about a dozen pedals. 
This gear however is spread across two spatially disparate locations because I frequently move from west coast to east coast and back again.
Thesis: looper is the only pedal. Back to basisc. Focus on the practice and sound.
